				<h1>About Covid-19</h1>
				<p>Cronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

                Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.

                The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. </p>

			<h3>Know How it Spreads</h3>
			<ul>
				
				<li>There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).</li>
				<li>The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
					<ul>
                <li>  Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).</li>
                <li>Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.</li>
